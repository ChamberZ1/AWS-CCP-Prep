## Evolution of Cloud Hosting

**Dedicated Server**
- One physical machine dedicated to a single business running a single web-app/site
- Very expensive (you front all the cost), high maintanence, but good security

**Virtual Private Server**
- One physical machine dedicated to a single business
- Physical machine is virtualized and divided into sub-machines
- Better utilization and isolation of resources, running multiple web-apps/sites
- Also expensive as you still need to purchase the hardware

**Shared Hosting**
- One physical machine shared by hundreds of businesses
- Relied on tenants under-utilizing resources
- Cheap, but limited functionality to the machine, and poor isolation (because you are sharing)

**Cloud Hosting**
- Multiple physical machines that act as one system
- System is abstracted into multiple cloud services
- Flexible (can ramp up or cut resources depending on need), scalable, secure (virtualized isolation), cost-effective, high configurability

*Cloud still includes all of these types of hosting*
